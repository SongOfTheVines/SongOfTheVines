- Hello World, @SongOfTheVines here
- I'm an author using github pages to host my work, because websites are Expensive and I am Yet Another Broke College Student.
- I also do some coding, probably because my major is in Computer Science. I may host some of it here at some point.
- If you like my work and want to see more of it, head on over to my website to donate. Subscribe to get all sorts of cool
  bonuses, like poetry, little extras from my upcoming book, and early access to all of my work. All that and more,
  available starting on 8/16/2021.
